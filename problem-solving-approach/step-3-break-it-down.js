// Section 4:21 - Step 3: Break It Down

// BREAK IT DOWN
// Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.

// This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it,
// and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings
// before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) 
// as well.

// Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

function charCount(str) {
  //do something
  //return an object with keys that are lowercase and alphanumeric characters in the string; 
  // values should be the counts for those characters
}

function charCount(str) {
  //make object to return at end
  //loop over string, for each caracter
  //if the char is a number/letter AND key in object, add one to count
  //if the char is a number/letter AND is not in object, add it and set value to 1
  //if the char is something else (space, period, etc) dont do anything
  //return object at end
}
