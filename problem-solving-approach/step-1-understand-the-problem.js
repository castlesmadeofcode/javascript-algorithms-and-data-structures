// Section 4:19 - Step 1: Understand The Problem

// [Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

// UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM:
// Q Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// A (write a function that adds two numbers and returns the total)

// Q What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// A (ints?, floats?, string for large numbers?)

// Q What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// A ints?, floats?, string for large numbers?

// Q Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough
// information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question
// until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering
// the question at this early stage.)
// A (In most cases yes, but what happens if someone passes in one number or a string? how do we want to handle that?)

// Q How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
// A(Num1 Num2 - args) (sum - result)
